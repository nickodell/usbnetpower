usbnetpower
===========

This is a fork of [usbnetpower](http://code.google.com/p/usbnetpower8800/) by Paul Marks that includes an install script. It also includes one extra command: reboot.

The install script will:

 1. Make it so you don't need to be root to toggle power/query the device.
 2. Install the dependencies (On CentOS, at least)
 3. Install the script to /bin/power

Example Usage
=============

`power on`
